# Assignment

> GKE includes monitoring systems already so we can just enable the monitoring.
> 
> Read documentation for Kubernetes Engine Monitoring [here](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/observability) and setup logging for the project in GKE.
> 
> You can optionally include Prometheus as well.
> 
> Submit a picture of the logs when a new todo is created.
