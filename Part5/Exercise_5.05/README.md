# Comparison

I chose to compare [Rancher](https://www.rancher.com/) to [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/).

Having reviewed online sources on both platforms, I conclude that Rancher is the better option for the following reasons:

- While both platforms are open source, Rancher is backed by a larger community of developers. At a glance it may seem that Portainer is more popular, since its [repo](https://github.com/portainer/portainer) has received more stars - 31.7 thousand stars, at the time of writing, compared to 23.7 thousand stars on Rancher's [repo](https://github.com/rancher/rancher). However, the number of forks, contributors and commits are all better indicators of the development effort put towards each platform by the open source community. Rancher's repo has been forked more than three thousand times, and has received almost 13 thousand commits from 285 contributors. While Portainer's repo has been forked two and a half thousand times and has only recieved five thousand commits from 224 contributors. This means that the number of people with deep expertise in Rancher is greater, which translates to greater odds at finding help with any issues that may be encountered.
- Rancher is an all-in-one robust, integrated and mature solution. "Rancher has mature applications that are built specifically for Rancher: CIS scanning for security benchmarks, Istio integration, logging, metrics, monitoring, backups and even a distributed block storage system. They are part of an integrated Rancher ecosystem." [3]
- Rancher has a unique feature that allows to organise several namespaces into projects that comes in handy when working in large environments. [4]
- Rancher integrates with Helmcharts, allowing to manage existing Helm deployments and custom resource types. [4]
- Rancher offers a desktop appllication in addition to the web-based GUI. [5]
- Rancher supports JSON resource definitions. [5]
- Rancher is 100% free no matter the size and configuration of the cluster, while Portainer's free Community Edition has limitations in comparison to the paid Business Edition. [5][6]
