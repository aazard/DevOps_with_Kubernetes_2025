## Assignment

> 
> Have the project respond something to a GET request sent to the project. A simple html page is good or you can deploy something more complex like a single-page-application.
> 
> See [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-environment-variable-container/) how you can define environment variables for containers.
> 
> Use `kubectl port-forward` to confirm that the project is accessible and works in the cluster by using a browser to access the project.
